2. Hosts and Total Number of Requests

In this challenge, write a program to analyze a log file and summarize the results.
Given a text file of an http requests log, list the number of requests from each host.
Output should be directed to a file as described in the Program Description below.

The format of the log file, a text file with a .txt extension, follows.
Each line contains a single log record with the following columns (in order):

    The hostname of the host making the request.

    The request, enclosed in quotes(eg, "GET/images/NASA-logosmall.gif HTTP/1.0").
    The HTTP response code.
    The total number of bytes sent in the response.

Function Description: Your function must create a unique list of hostnames with their number of requests and output to a file names records_filename where filename is names records_filename where filename is replaced with input filename.
Each hostname should be followed by a space then the number of requests and a newline.
Order doesn't matter.
